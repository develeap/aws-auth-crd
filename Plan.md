# Work Plan

1. Set up the development environment:
   - Install Python and pip (if not already installed).
   - Set up a virtual environment for your project.
   - Install necessary dependencies, such as the Kubernetes Python client library (`kubernetes` package) using pip.

2. Understand the CRD specification:
   - Familiarize yourself with the CRD you'll be working with, including its API structure, attributes, and behavior.
   - Identify the required operations you need to handle (e.g., create, read, update, delete).

3. Connect to the Kubernetes cluster:
   - Configure the Kubernetes client to connect to your target cluster.
   - Set up authentication and access control, such as using service account credentials or kubeconfig file.

4. Create the CRD handler code structure:
   - Create a Python module or package to encapsulate your CRD handling logic.
   - Define the necessary classes and functions to interact with the Kubernetes API.

5. Implement CRUD operations:
   - Write functions/methods to handle the CRUD (create, read, update, delete) operations for your CRD.
   - Use the Kubernetes client library to interact with the Kubernetes API and perform the required operations.
   - Validate and sanitize user input to ensure data integrity.

6. Handle events and reconcile changes:
   - Set up event handlers to react to changes in your CRD resources (e.g., using watch API or informers).
   - Implement logic to reconcile any changes or discrepancies between the desired state and the actual state of the resources.

7. Implement error handling and logging:
   - Add appropriate error handling mechanisms to handle exceptions, retries, and error reporting.
   - Implement logging to capture relevant information for debugging and monitoring purposes.

8. Test and debug:
   - Write unit tests to validate the functionality of your CRD handler code.
   - Debug and fix any issues or errors that arise during testing.

9. Document and deploy:
   - Document the usage and configuration of your CRD handler.
   - Create deployment manifests or Helm charts for deploying your CRD handler to a Kubernetes cluster.

10. Continuous integration and deployment (CI/CD):
    - Set up CI/CD pipelines to automate testing, building, and deploying your CRD handler.
    - Integrate with version control systems and CI/CD platforms like GitLab CI, Jenkins, or GitHub Actions.

Remember that this task list serves as a general guideline, and the specific requirements and implementation details may vary based on your CRD's complexity and your application's needs.
