# The conversation with ChatGPT

1. __Me:__ Play the role of python developer.

   __Chat:__ Sure
2. __Me:__ As a python developer you need to write kubernetes crd handler. Make a task list for the application.
   
   __Chat:__ Sure! Here's a task list for developing a Kubernetes Custom Resource Definition (CRD) handler in Python:
3. __Me:__ Start from step 4. Write a basic structure.
    
    __Chat:__ Sure.
4. __Me:__ Define how will crd look for interacting with aws-auth ConfigMap.

    __Chat:__ To interact with the aws-auth ConfigMap in Kubernetes, you would typically define a Custom Resource Definition (CRD) that represents the desired state of the aws-auth ConfigMap. Here's an example of how the CRD might look.

    In this example, the CRD is defined with the following attributes:

    * apiVersion: Specifies the API version for the CustomResourceDefinition.
    * kind: Specifies the kind of the CustomResourceDefinition.
    * metadata: Contains metadata about the CustomResourceDefinition, such as its name.
    * group: Specifies the API group that the CRD belongs to.
    * versions: Specifies the versions of the CRD that are available.
    * scope: Defines the scope of the CRD, which can be either Namespaced or Cluster.
    * names: Specifies the names used for the CustomResourceDefinition, including the plural, singular, and kind.

    Once the CRD is defined, you can create instances of the AWSAuth resource to represent the desired state of the aws-auth ConfigMap. Here's an example of how an AWSAuth resource might look:

    In this example, the AWSAuth resource defines the desired state of the aws-auth ConfigMap. It specifies the mapping of IAM roles and users to Kubernetes usernames and groups. The mapRoles field maps an IAM role to a Kubernetes username and group, while the mapUsers field maps an IAM user to a Kubernetes username and group.

    Note that the actual structure and fields of the AWSAuth resource would depend on the specific requirements and conventions of your application and the aws-auth ConfigMap.
5. __Me:__ Change crd_handler.py to handle aws-auth crd from previous step.

    __Chat:__ Certainly! Here's an updated version of the crd_handler.py file that includes functions to handle the AWSAuth CRD, specifically for interacting with the aws-auth ConfigMap. In this updated version, the CRDHandler class includes functions specifically tailored to handle the AWSAuth resource.

    Note that the code assumes that you have already set up the Kubernetes API client and have appropriate authentication and access control in place.

    You can use these functions in your code to create, retrieve, update, and delete instances of the AWSAuth resource in the aws-auth ConfigMap. Remember to replace "stable.example.com" with the actual API group and "v1" with the appropriate version for your CRD.
6. __Me:__ Assume that you only reading created AWSAuth  and listen to AWSAuth change or delition. Update crd_handler.py and main.py accordingly.

    __Chat:__ This updated version of crd_handler.py removes the functions for creating, getting, updating, and deleting the AWSAuth resource since they are no longer needed. The focus is now solely on the watch_awsauth() method, which establishes a watch on the AWSAuth resources in the specified namespace and listens for changes and deletions.
    In this updated version, the main() function creates an instance of CRDHandler and calls the watch_awsauth() method with the desired namespace, which in this case is "kube-system". This will initiate the watch and continuously listen for changes and deletions of the AWSAuth resource in the specified namespace.
7. __Me:__ Note that in AWSAuth can be only mapRoles or mapUsers but not both.

    __Chat:__ If the AWSAuth resource can only have either mapRoles or mapUsers but not both, you can update the code accordingly.  The code checks if both mapRoles and mapUsers exist in the AWSAuth resource's specification. If both properties are present, it prints an error message indicating that the AWSAuth resource can only have mapRoles or mapUsers, but not both.
8. __Me:__ Make a aws_auth_handler.py that will update the aws-auth configmap.

    __Chat:__ The AWSAuthHandler class has an update_awsauth_configmap() method that takes in the target namespace and the updated data to be set in the aws-auth ConfigMap. It uses the Kubernetes client library to read the existing ConfigMap, update the data section, and replace the ConfigMap with the updated version.
9. __Me:__ Add aws_auth_handler.py usage to crd_handler.py when AWSAuth created updated and deleted

    __Chat:__ In this updated version, the CRDHandler class has a new method called handle_awsauth_event(), which takes the event type (ADDED, MODIFIED, or DELETED) and the AWSAuth resource as input. It checks the event type and the presence of either mapRoles or mapUsers in the AWSAuth resource's specification. If mapRoles is present, it updates the aws-auth ConfigMap with the mapRoles data. If mapUsers is present, it updates the ConfigMap with the mapUsers data. If neither is present, it prints an error message.
