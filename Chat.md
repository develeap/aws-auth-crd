# The conversation with ChatGPT

1. __Me:__ Play the role of python developer.

   __Chat:__ Sure
2. __Me:__ As a python developer you need to write kubernetes crd handler. Make a task list for the application.
   
   __Chat:__ Sure! Here's a task list for developing a Kubernetes Custom Resource Definition (CRD) handler in Python:
3. __Me:__ Start from step 4. Write a basic structure.
    
    __Chat:__ Sure.
4. __Me:__ Define how will crd look for interacting with aws-auth ConfigMap.

    __Chat:__ To interact with the aws-auth ConfigMap in Kubernetes, you would typically define a Custom Resource Definition (CRD) that represents the desired state of the aws-auth ConfigMap. Here's an example of how the CRD might look.

    In this example, the CRD is defined with the following attributes:

    * apiVersion: Specifies the API version for the CustomResourceDefinition.
    * kind: Specifies the kind of the CustomResourceDefinition.
    * metadata: Contains metadata about the CustomResourceDefinition, such as its name.
    * group: Specifies the API group that the CRD belongs to.
    * versions: Specifies the versions of the CRD that are available.
    * scope: Defines the scope of the CRD, which can be either Namespaced or Cluster.
    * names: Specifies the names used for the CustomResourceDefinition, including the plural, singular, and kind.

    Once the CRD is defined, you can create instances of the AWSAuth resource to represent the desired state of the aws-auth ConfigMap. Here's an example of how an AWSAuth resource might look:

    In this example, the AWSAuth resource defines the desired state of the aws-auth ConfigMap. It specifies the mapping of IAM roles and users to Kubernetes usernames and groups. The mapRoles field maps an IAM role to a Kubernetes username and group, while the mapUsers field maps an IAM user to a Kubernetes username and group.

    Note that the actual structure and fields of the AWSAuth resource would depend on the specific requirements and conventions of your application and the aws-auth ConfigMap.
5. __Me:__ Change crd_handler.py to handle aws-auth crd from previous step.

    __Chat:__ Certainly! Here's an updated version of the crd_handler.py file that includes functions to handle the AWSAuth CRD, specifically for interacting with the aws-auth ConfigMap. In this updated version, the CRDHandler class includes functions specifically tailored to handle the AWSAuth resource.

    Note that the code assumes that you have already set up the Kubernetes API client and have appropriate authentication and access control in place.

    You can use these functions in your code to create, retrieve, update, and delete instances of the AWSAuth resource in the aws-auth ConfigMap. Remember to replace "stable.example.com" with the actual API group and "v1" with the appropriate version for your CRD.
